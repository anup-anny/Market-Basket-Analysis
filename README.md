# Project Description:
The Market Basket Analysis for Superstore is a data-driven project designed to identify product associations and recommend additional products for customers based on their past purchasing behavior. The project utilizes a transactional dataset containing 7051 rows of customer purchase data at a superstore, which includes information on the items purchased and the corresponding transaction IDs.

To conduct market basket analysis, an Apriori algorithm was applied to identify frequently occurring itemsets in the transactional data. The Apriori algorithm allowed for the identification of product associations based on the frequency of co-occurrence in customer baskets. This approach can help identify product bundles or cross-sell opportunities to boost sales and customer satisfaction.

Next, a recommendation system was built that utilizes the frequent itemsets to suggest additional products that customers may be interested in purchasing. The recommendation system utilizes collaborative filtering to identify the products that are frequently purchased together and recommends them to customers who have purchased one or more items in the set.

The Market Basket Analysis for Superstore has the potential to provide valuable insights to the superstore on customer purchase behavior and preferences, which can help them optimize product placement, promotional strategies, and pricing to drive sales and improve customer satisfaction.
